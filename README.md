# AI Wine Analysis: Predicting Alcohol Content Using Machine Learning

## Abstract

This project applied several machine learning regression algorithms to estimate alcohol levels based on the physicochemical properties of red wine from the UCI Wine Quality dataset. The models evaluated included linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting regressors, LightGBM, XGBoost, and cat boost regressors. The CatBoost Regressor outperformed others, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3321, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.4873, and an R-squared value of 0.7818. Ensemble methods such as stacking further improved prediction accuracy. Model interpretation using SHAP values revealed that density, fixed acidity, residual sugar, and quality significantly impacted alcohol prediction. The findings demonstrate that machine learning models, especially CatBoost Regressor, can accurately predict alcohol content in red wine, seemingly offering a valuable tool for winemakers and quality assurance processes.
